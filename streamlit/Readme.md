we have four apps which built with streamlit library.


Packages:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```







1-BMI Calculator: Enter your height and weight and see result.


How to run :

```streamlit run bmi_calculator.py```






2-Blur Image: It's obvious, you should upload your image and then you can blur it with slidebar.


How to run :

```streamlit run blur_image.py```




3-Counter: Simple counter with up and down button. When you work with streamlit, it's difficult to store value of variables, so the main challenge is here.


How to run :

```streamlit run counter.py```




4-Data-Science: It's just a simple app for showing csv file and draw chart from them, just upload csv file and see the result.
